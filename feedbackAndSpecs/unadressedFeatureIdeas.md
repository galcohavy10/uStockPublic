## ASAP To-DOS

- [ ] tapping a link anywhere opens webview in app (ai chats)
- [ ] Explore stocks from fellow stocks views




## (pushed for later due to difficulty -> utility ratio OR to simplify feature set)
- [ ] Better typing look across the app, first letter of a sentence gets empasized on appearing and it looks more like actual human typing with a typewriter. Also increase readability with the first-letter emphasis thing
- [ ] Optional notifications for ideas, “take a nap” and able to integrate this with api
- [ ] Sense if a task is done and send notification, “you went to “Gym!” Good job. (This is more complex and long term).
- [ ] In some instances, journeys can be very small pills that you can scroll through more, same with aspect explorer then when u click one it expands to the full preview we have currently.
- [ ] Only save photos in videos that were taken in house and also make an option not to
- [ ] Very high quality trimming of video and audio
- [ ] video filters, etc
- [ ] image filters, settings, etc
- [ ] So many unnecessary post requests, refactor
- [ ] No more authorized URLs, makes no sense rn. Comment out code and change AWS settings 
- [ ] competition icons
- [ ]  posting costs UUbux so ppl get another reward for being valuable and gaining uBux
- [ ] moree value add from uBux - exclusive communities and features as well as different looking profile
- [ ] Different design background of each community- consider 3rd party library
- [ ] Hide things when you scroll down and then they come up when you scroll back up, all around the app
- [ ] Llama on server ability 
- [ ] Figure out vid & img FFMPEG compression state of the art and implement (or just use native iPhone compress)
- [ ] Cache stock and posts and/or stock on the user’s device and then fetching with tail to simplify
- [ ] Add share post from photos app or audio.
- [ ] Implement ability to share chats.
- [ ] Implement globally interactive @'s (tagging, tapping anywhere).
- [ ] Unblocking functionality: pretty complex but use two-way checks on server
- [ ] Abstractly, create a Machine Learning model to recommend posts and users with aligned interests to the people.
- [ ] REFACTOR CODEBASE FOR simplicity, uniformity, good documentation and onboarding
3D Touch..?
- [ ] Difficulty level and battery system, where your capacity can increase bit by bit every time and each task can take up a relative amount of battery
- [ ] Siri, voice command anything
- [ ] FAMILY & Business dynamic to delegate chores to children or delegate tasks to employees as well as rate their submission which effects their in-company rating/
- [ ] Educator mode: give students & teachers easy way to integrate exam dates, different study guidelines and resources. 
- [ ] Focus on the Personal Trainer Demographic, can also be a tool for personal trainers who want to motivate their students
- [ ] Break down bot customizability to steps/have advanced settings available
- [ ] Progress reports every week or so
- [ ] Nudger: learn my weak points and use AI for good, to manipulate me to be better. Suggest features most useful for consistency and connection
- [ ] Monthly self- authoring
- [ ] Task with a friend, - collaborate, integrate with another app, zoom, whiteboard, etc…)
- [ ] Suggest tasks to friends
- [ ] Optimize a learning chat for just languages and make sure the system message is appropriate and the languages supported is clear as well.
- [ ] if ppl use the stock trading a lot, then add a feature to freeze another transaction for a few days.
- [ ] Add private messages, and make it accessible through notifications tab + usable in intuitive places
- [ ] how does posting tasks into comps, or communities change anything? How can this be useful?
- [ ] Too many sheets use sheets or fullscreencovers where suitable and just make it feel and look like a navlink 
- [ ] Make a dark mode
- [ ] Implement Autofill provider for sign in.
- [ ] Implement carousel view for image posts or carousel with external API data.
- [ ] Want privacy on all my posts or competitions or my profile, more privacy options
- [ ] Used cached post view assets to advertise a feature user might not know about. Use these to educate bout more features and use cases.
- [ ] Automatic gender allocation algorithm based on provided name using npm genderize, then use gender to enhance AI model’s ability to recommend things
- [ ] Icons or thumbnails to describe competitions
- [ ] Task creation: time, location has suggestions as well so more info is filled out








## Potential NEVERs (may change my mind and come around to these)

- [ ]  Implement Google and Apple signup and login. Reason why not: uStock should be valuable enough to want to go through signup process. Also encourages a better landing page.
