***This task was assigned by Gal C. for Marco Krause on August 6th, 2023***

Your job is to use the existing files at **app/src/main/java/data_structures** to build an API and uHeroView on the android app.

James has already built a significant chunk of the android authentication view, PostView, as well as some of the API functions.

It is your job to integrate another view into his android project that will be called uHeroView. For now, it will only be able to access the uHero API.

**Two files will be attached for this task, a uHeroView and a AI_API file.**

The API file will access the backend and serve you a stream of text, if and only if you provide it with the correct parameters.
Additionally, be sure to always use correct URLs when accessing the backend functions, and to use the POST method, not GET or anything similar.

For the view, you may model the view's logic after the uHeroView but keep in mind that this view has been refined for months now and you should start from a very basic version that looks like shit for now as long as it works then it's beautiful in its own right (for now).
