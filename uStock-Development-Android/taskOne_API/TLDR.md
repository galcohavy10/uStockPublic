## TLDR:

#### Use given files to:
1. Create a post data structure
2. Build an api.
3. Test api until it successfully requests for and gets an array of posts.
4. Make a simple postview of how you will display a post.
5. Make a JourneyView that, on appearing, makes a server request with your api and gets the array of posts.
6. Display the posts in a scrollable view in JourneyView.
