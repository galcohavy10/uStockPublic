### TLDR: TASK 2 DUE JULY 20th

## Use given files to:

1. Fully build authentication with the API
2. Handle errors and successful authentication
3. User logs in and pass the UserID to get posts for that user when authenticated
4. PostViews can get media and be more aesthetically pleasing.

#### Read the files very carefully to be sure you are looking at it step by step.
note: just slap all the server stuff in the api folder for now, seeing as how the app is rather simple.
