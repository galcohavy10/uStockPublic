#### There's a lot of hidden features:
1. The follow button
2. Commenting
3. Voting
4. Reporting Spam
5. Seeing the Community and Aspect color
6. Share button
7. Created at date

##### Here's what you can try to implement when you build your posts.
- Differentiate, make sure to create clear distinctions from content, caption or any component. Use size, font to mimic what exists.
- Use good spacing
- Show when something is loading with a loading wheel

###### If you finish all the necessary api connections and necessary view components, I'll upload more feature specs for the post.
